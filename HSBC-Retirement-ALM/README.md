##  Project Team & Context

This repository hosts the work of a group of **4 students from ENSAE Paris** (National School of Statistics and Economic Administration).

This project was conducted as part of our actuarial and financial curriculum, under the expert supervision of **HSBC**. The objective was to model, backtest, and optimize long-term investment strategies for retirement savings, bridging theoretical academic research with practical banking constraints.

##  Context: The Pension Crisis
*Why Funded Pension Schemes (Capitalisation) Matter*

Demographic transitions in developed economies, particularly in France, are placing unprecedented strain on traditional Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) pension systems.
* [cite_start]**Demographic Pressure:** Increasing life expectancy and lower fertility rates are drastically raising the old-age dependency ratio[cite: 46, 47, 88].
* [cite_start]**Systemic Sustainability:** With fewer workers supporting each retiree, the replacement rates of mandatory public pensions are under pressure[cite: 222].
* [cite_start]**The Shift:** To maintain their standard of living post-retirement, individuals must increasingly rely on supplementary **Defined Contribution (DC)** schemes (retraite par capitalisation)[cite: 168, 223].

This project explores how to optimize these supplementary savings to maximize terminal wealth while managing the risks of inflation and market volatility over a 30-40 year horizon.
